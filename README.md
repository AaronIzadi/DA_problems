# DA_problems

This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DA) problems** that Iâ€™ve worked on, implemented, and organized for learning, practice, and reference.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- Solutions to various algorithmic problems (both classic and custom)
- Implementations of core data structures
- Practice problems inspired by:
  - Competitive programming contests
  - University coursework
  - Problem sets from books (e.g., CLRS)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Java** â€” main language used for solutions

## ðŸ“‹ Topics Covered

âœ… Sorting and searching algorithms 
âœ… Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST)  
âœ… Dynamic programming  
âœ… Greedy algorithms  
âœ… Divide and conquer  
âœ… Heaps and priority queues
